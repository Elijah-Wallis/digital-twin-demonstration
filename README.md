# Eve Digital Twin Demonstration

## Overview

The flagship B2B lead magnet for Eve L5_Medspa_IaC. Clinic owners input 5 KPIs and instantly receive a live "Digital Twin" of their practice running under full autonomous ontology — revenue projections, staff reduction, hidden leaks, and a downloadable branded PDF report.
